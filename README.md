# Stories of Us

Stories of Us is a serious board game that embraces "neighbours" to get to know each other on a personal level, but also on a cooperation level.
Within the theme of empowerment of citizens, this game is a pawn to create alignment of norms and values, a shared understanding, motivation and communication between neighbours to incentivize positive changes. The core concept of Storytelling has proven to be a successful way of bringing people closer together.
This project was part of the course SEN9235 - Game Design Project and was in cooperation with clients Ir. Geertje Slingerland & Nicolai Hansen.

## How-To

This repo exists of 4 parts:
- Report

In the report the base line and adventure can be found that lead to the final serious game "Stories of Us".
Next to the reasoning for the present game elements and a ruleset needed to play the game, the report has a literature review on both the issue of poor empowerment as well as the usage of serious gaming as a solution.
The lion's share of the report is about the iterative testing of game concepts and choices made during this proces.
The game has been created in such a fashion that changes to the theme and lessons learned of the game can be altered easily, as storytelling can be used for a variety of goals.

- Playing Board + Artwork

These are the necessary materials to be able to play the serious game yourself, which can be printed and changed into other themes.

- Facilitation Document

As Stories of Us is a serious game, the learning and activation of players is key. To support these processes we included a facilitation document for the person who can guide the players through the game. With this addition the probability of the goal of the game being achieved increases.
